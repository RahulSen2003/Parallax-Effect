            <p class="text">
                Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known where life developed and
                found habitability. This is enabled by Earth being a water world, the only one in the Solar System
                sustaining liquid surface water. Almost all of Earth's water is contained in its global ocean, spanning
                70.8% of Earth's surface. The remaining 29.2% of Earth's surface is land, most of which is located in
                the form of continential landmasses within one hemisphere, Earth's land hemisphere. Most of Earth's land
                is somewhat humid and covered by vegetation, while large sheets of ice at Earth's polar deserts retain
                more water than Earth's groundwater, lakes, rivers and atmospheric water together. Earth's land is part
                of Earth's crust, consisting of several slowly moving tectonic plates, which interact to produce
                mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Inside Earth's crust is a liquid outer core that generates
                the magnetosphere, deflecting most of the destructive solar winds and cosmic radiation.\
                <br></br>
                Earth has a dynamic atmosphere, which sustains Earth's surface conditions and protects it from most
                meteoroids and UV-light at entry. It has a composition of primarily nitrogen and oxygen. Water vapor is
                widely present in the atmosphere, forming clouds that cover most of the planet. The water vapor acts as
                a greenhouse gas and, together with other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, particularly carbon
                dioxide (CO2), creates the conditions for both liquid surface water and water vapor to persist via the
                capturing of energy from the Sun's light.

            <p class="text">
                The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. Its diameter is about one-quarter of Earth's (comparable to
                the width of Australia), making it the fifth largest satellite in the Solar System and the largest
                and most massive relative to its parent planet. It is larger than all known dwarf planets in the Solar
                System. The Moon is a planetary-mass object with a differentiated rocky body, making it a satellite
                planet under the geophysical definitions of the term. It lacks any significant atmosphere, hydrosphere,
                or magnetic field. Its surface gravity is about one-sixth of Earth's at 0.1654 g—Jupiter's moon Io is
                the only satellite in the Solar System known to have a higher surface gravity and density.
                <br></br>
                The Moon orbits Earth at an average distance of 384,400 km (238,900 mi), or about 30 times Earth's
                diameter. Its gravitational influence is the main driver of Earth's tides and very slowly lengthens
                Earth's day. The Moon's orbit around Earth has a sidereal period of 27.3 days. During each synodic
                period of 29.5 days, the amount of the Moon's Earth-facing surface that is illuminated by the Sun varies
                from none up to nearly 100%, resulting in lunar phases that form the basis for the months of a lunar
                calendar.

                The Solar System[c] is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it. The
                largest of such objects are the eight planets, in order from the Sun: four terrestrial planets named
                Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, two gas giants named Jupiter and Saturn, and two ice giants named Uranus
                and Neptune. The terrestrial planets have a definite surface and are mostly made of rock and metal. The
                gas giants are mostly made of hydrogen and helium, while the ice giants are mostly made of 'volatile'
                substances such as water, ammonia, and methane. In some texts, these terrestrial and giant planets are
                called the inner Solar System and outer Solar System planets respectively.
                <br></br>
                The Solar System was formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant
                interstellar molecular cloud. Over time, the cloud formed the Sun and a protoplanetary disk that
                gradually coalesced to form planets and other objects. That is the reason why all eight planets have an
                orbit that lies near the same plane. In the present day, 99.86% of the Solar System's mass is in the Sun
                and most of the remaining mass is contained in the planet Jupiter. Six planets, the six largest possible
                dwarf planets and many other bodies have natural satellites or moons orbiting around them. All giant
                planets and a few smaller bodies are encircled by planetary rings, composed of ice, dust and sometimes
                moonlets.

            </div>
            <p class="text">
                The Milky Way[c] is the galaxy that includes the Solar System, with the name describing the galaxy's
                appearance from Earth: a hazy band of light seen in the night sky formed from stars that cannot be
                individually distinguished by the naked eye. The term Milky Way is a translation of the Latin via
                lactea, from the Greek γαλακτικὸς κύκλος (galaktikòs kýklos), meaning "milky circle". From
                Earth, the Milky Way appears as a band because its disk-shaped structure is viewed from within. Galileo
                Galilei first resolved the band of light into individual stars with his telescope in 1610. Until the
                early 1920s, most astronomers thought that the Milky Way contained all the stars in the Universe.[28]
                Following the 1920 Great Debate between the astronomers Harlow Shapley and Heber Doust Curtis,[29]
                observations by Edwin Hubble showed that the Milky Way is just one of many galaxies.
                <br></br>
                The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy with a D25 isophotal diameter estimated at 26.8 ± 1.1
                kiloparsecs (87,400 ± 3,590 light-years), but only about 1,000 light-years thick at the spiral arms
                (more at the bulge). Recent simulations suggest that a dark matter area, also containing some visible
                stars, may extend up to a diameter of almost 2 million light-years (613 kpc). The Milky Way has
                several satellite galaxies and is part of the Local Group of galaxies, which form part of the Virgo
                Supercluster, which is itself a component of the Laniakea Supercluster.
